This directory contains the bash settings that I want to be common to all
my bash configurations.  Here is how to use it:

You should have in your home directory:
- a directory called bash
- a file called .bashrc

The directory should be this one (the one containing this README).

The .bashrc file should contain the following line:
source bash/bashrc

I have also included my screenrc file; there doesn't seem to be a better way to use it than to copy it to ~/.screenrc.

That is all.
